# Applying-Snapchat-Filter-on-given-Image
Built Snapchat like face filters - eyeglasses and mustache for input Image

# prerequisites
1. Install Python
2. Install jupyter notebook (Jupyter notebook is a web application that provides an interactive environment for computing and analyzing the data)
3. install openCV, Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib.pyplot on it.

OpenCV : OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as Numpuy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features.

Numpy : NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy stands for Numerical Python. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster that traditional Python lists.

Pandas : pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with 'relationa' or 'labeled' data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

matplotlib.pyplot : Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and various graphical user interface toolkits like Tkinter, awxPython, etc.
Pyplot is a Matplotlib module which provides a MATLAB-like interface. Matplotlib is designed to be as usable as MATLAB, with the ability to use Python and the advantage of being free and open-source. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. The various plots we can utilize using Pyplot are Line Plot, Histogram, Scatter, 3D Plot, Image, Contour, and Polar.

# About Repository
In this repository, I'm building snapchat like face filters - eyeglasses and moustache for popular Game Of Throne Characters Tyrion Lannister and Jaime.
You will be given an input image and two image templates (one for sunglasses & moustache , task is to overlay the eyeglasses and moustache on the given character). To detect the facial keypoints like position of eyes and nose, I'm used haarcascade xml files (as training data).
